## 🔍 Overview

Customer segmentation is crucial in marketing and product personalization. This project uses **K-Means clustering** to group customers based on spending patterns and annual income, helping businesses identify distinct customer profiles.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

> _"How can we divide customers into meaningful clusters based on their annual income and spending score?"_

This helps in:
- Targeted marketing strategies
- Personalized services
- Enhancing customer satisfaction

---

## 💡 Solution Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and scaling.
3. **Elbow Method**: Identifying the optimal number of clusters.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: Applying unsupervised learning to segment data.
5. **Visualization**: Plotting clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python
- 📘 Jupyter Notebook
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy
- 📉 Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 🧠 Scikit-learn (KMeans)
